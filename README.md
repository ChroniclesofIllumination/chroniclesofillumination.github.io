## Purpose
* The main purpose of this blog is to document tidbits about topics I find interesting. 
* They have mostly been what I have learnt in the recent past or what I'm currently learning.
* Now and then, I might post small tutorials as well.

## About Me
* I am doing my undergraduate studies in Materials Science and Engineering.
* I am an enthusiast when it comes to nearly everything -> (Note that this may not be a very productive strategy).
* I like to find correlations between many things that are seemingly different but are fundamentally linked.
* Maybe one day I’ll drown in my curiosity but I'm willing to take the risk. 

> The world is too big to not find anything new to think about every day. The only question is, “Will You?”.

I’ve decided I will. Let’s see where it takes me.
**The Ascent Begins.**
