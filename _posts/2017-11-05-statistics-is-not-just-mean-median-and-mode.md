Today, being [Hirotugu Akaike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirotugu_Akaike)'s birthday, is an apt day to appreciate Statistics. While it isn't true that I've never underestimated statistics or its power, I wasn't the person inclined towards learning more about it. I left it for "others" to pursue while just getting away with knowing how to do the calculations of standard deviations for fictitious "Class Marks" datasets that creep their way into every Mathematics exam that had Statistics in its syllabus. I never got the answers right, but that's beside the point. Now that I'm finally allowed to use calculators to do the dirty work, I see the beauty that lies beneath. So, yes, this is not a lament.

What if you have lots and lots of data? They mean nothing unless you make sense of them.Â Statistics is beautiful because it helps you make sense out of these numbers. What really took me by surprise today was "[Box Plots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot)" (check out this [link](http://www.physics.csbsju.edu/stats/box2.html) to get a good yet brief description of Box Plots, it has a nice example to go with it as well). To me, this neat system is quite a clever way of representing the crux of the entire data set in a crisp manner. One look at the box plot, you already know so much about the data. It's great for comparisons as well, when you need to quickly get an idea of how some feature varies with some other feature, provided other variables are kept constant. It does have its "demerits" but it's a handy tool nevertheless.

This "fresh" aspect of statistics that I discovered today made me wonder how misrepresented Statistics was in my head. Suddenly, I've forgotten all the dreary mistakes I made in simple calculations, I now see statistics as some kind of "sleuthing" tool to prod information out of data. There are lots of different ways to get insights from data. The more tools you have, the more right insights you get. The sooner you realise this, the better it is for you in this information driven world.

Statistics is NOT just Mean, Median and Mode.
