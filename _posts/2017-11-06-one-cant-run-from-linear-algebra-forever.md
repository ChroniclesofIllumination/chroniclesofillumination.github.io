Linear Algebra is omnipresent. You learn it when you start learning vectors and graphs of straight lines and planes, you also learn it if you're doing Quantum Mechanics, Computational Engineering or Machine Learning. It occupies a niche area in Mathematics by being equally appreciated by both Pure and Applied Mathematicians. Â The reason why it's very useful is probably because it addresses fundamental questions, who knew linear equations could have such vast reaches?

Actually, most people do realise this. If you didn't, you know now. I did. That's why I always look at it like looking at a bunch of candies through the glass of the shop. Quite literally, because I have never done any extensive course on Linear Algebra so far (though I tried to, the teacher was peculiar as well as demotivating). We don't have much to complain about though, MIT-OCW has a very famous course on Linear Algebra [here](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/). We could (and should) work through at least this much Linear Algebra to grasp the essence of it.

The reason I brought Linear Algebra up today is because I was learning [Principal Component Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis) (PCA), just the basics, and was naturally pointed to [Singular Value Decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular-value_decomposition) (SVD). My teacher asked us to understand what SVD does by comparing the result of it to the eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix. The answer (spoiler alert!) is that SVD gives the eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix. SVD is also used extensively to find inverses of huge matrices when [LU Decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LU_decomposition) may not work. You can read [this](http://www.gibiansky.com/blog/mathematics/cool-linear-algebra-singular-value-decomposition/index.html) brilliant blog post on the beauty of SVD, it's much more extensive (and useful) than my tiny post here.

If one keeps digging into Linear Algebra, there will always be surprises to find. There will always be some nuance which you didn't realise before, or you may even find an amazing "geometric" interpretation of something which you only knew as equations before. There are loads of Linear Algebra resources out there waiting, jump right in instead of avoiding it.

One can't run from Linear Algebra forever.
