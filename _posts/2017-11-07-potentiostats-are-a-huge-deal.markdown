One common way to observe the effect of the environment on a material is by performing electrochemical experiments and observing corrosion parameters, including the corrosion potential and corrosion rate. While corrosion doesn't sound fancy or glamorous, it's still so important for nearly every material changes some of its properties on exposure to all kinds of environments. The more we ignore corrosion, the more we pay for it, literally. The cost of corrosion runs into billions of dollars. It's found on the Statue of Liberty and it's also found on your door hinge. Why, even food items degrade and become rancid. Thus, it's important that we ignore the uninviting external aspects and dig into the mechanisms that lead to this issue. This revelation isn't what I learnt today, all this was for just giving you context.

Electrochemical experiments almost always require a device called a [Potentiostat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potentiostat)Â (-_stat_, of course, hints that there's something static). This is used in a three electrode electrochemical cell for the experiments. The purpose of the potentiostat is to keep the potential difference in the cell a constant. It changes the current drawn from the counter electrode in such a way that the reference electrode and working electrode have a constant potential difference between them.

Till today, I didn't know that these devices were useful in many other applications, nor did I know the challenges that arise while building such a device. I tried to make a simple version, didn't even get that right! So that's the thing, there are lots of devices out there, which has taken a lot of research to develop, that we take for granted. There's always more to it than what meets the eye. The next time you think something is easy, first of all, try doing it yourself. If you want to, you can follow the circuit on the wiki page above, get a bunch of wires, breadboard, a potentiometer and an op-amp. You're all set.

Potentiostats are a huge deal.
