Traditionally, casting is looked at as just a manufacturing process. It is very easy to mistake it to be "an old fashioned" field. But when one looks at it in detail, and goes through the mathematics that govern solidification, his or her viewpoint completely gets transformed. The transformation in my head happened about a year or so ago. But today, I watched solidification happen (videos) and it was simply a satisfying experience.

[Synchrotrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchrotron)Â are high energy X-ray sources. The X-rays are released by high energy electrons as they circulate around the synchrotron. Using these synchrotron X-rays, we can observe how solidification actually happens. We can get the crystallography of the sample within a fraction of a second and this helps in understanding the phenomena that happen at very small time-scales. Trust me when I say that it's beautiful. It almost made my jaw drop to the ground.

Maybe for an experienced person, the observation of dendrites may not seem very new or exciting, but one only needs open mindedness to look at something and fully appreciate its beauty. I tried to find the links to the videos I watched today, I could not find them. I will keep an eye out for them and post the links here if I do manage to find them.

Observing solidification using synchrotrons is worth the effort.
