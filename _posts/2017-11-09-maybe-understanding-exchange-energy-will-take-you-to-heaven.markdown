First off, I'll establish that I don't have anything against religion and have no intention of debating on the existence of God. I'd call myself a believer in God, but that's purely my choice and I'll leave you to choose yours. What I mean by "heaven" here is the meaning we intend when we use the word informally - a place, state, or experience of supreme bliss.

Exchange energy is due to the interaction of electrons among themselves. Quantum Chemistry talks about [Hund's Rule of maximum multiplicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hund%27s_rule_of_maximum_multiplicity). We say that there's a reduction in the energy of the system in half-shell and full-shell configurations because of the "exchange energy". Exchange interaction is the tendency of individual atomic magnetic moments to align the neighbouring atomic moments with itself. If this tendency leads to them being parallelly aligned, we get a ferromagnetic substance. If the alignment is anti-parallel, we get an anti-ferromagnetic substance.

In Physics, [exchange interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_interaction) has been in existence since 1926. However, it's still very difficult to obtain this numerically because it depends on the wave functions of the electrons involved, and calculation of individual wave functions is not easy at all. There are techniques such as [Density Functional Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_functional_theory) (DFT) which try to approximate the Exchange Energy to a [functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_(mathematics)) form. No one knows the exact functional form yet. It's not far-fetched to say that when the exact functional form is discovered, it's going to be a sure shot Nobel Prize winning discovery. Some say it may never be found. But many agree it can be. Who knows?

Maybe, understanding Exchange Energy will take you to "heaven".
