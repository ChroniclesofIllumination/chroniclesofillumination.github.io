[Control Engineering](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_engineering) is one of the most crucial aspects of designing a system for an application. In this era where Machine Learning is omnipresent, we often see examples of machines performing human-like activities, be it participating in intelligent conversations or driving vehicles. But control engineering gives us a much simpler and "hardware based" route to get machines perform useful (and entertaining) activities, and obviously, they it has been around for a long time.

For the past two weeks, I have been dabbling with the basics of control engineering. This is a rather tangential path for me to take because it has very a negligible relation to my major in college. But since I'm going to be someday called an "engineer", it'll be shameful if I don't know a thing or two about such an important thing as control systems. So, when I was given an opportunity to test these waters, I didn't think twice. I knew that I would not have much guidance during my work, but I was up for the challenge. After all, I had access to the internet; what could possibly be impossible given that?

I admit that when I started my journey, I made next to no progress. I didn't understand most of the technical terms that I found in nearly all online resources. I was struggling to place whether something that I didn't understand was actually part of the problem I was working on, thereby needing immediate attention, or if it was just a carryover topic from other related areas of the broad field of Electrical and Electronics Engineering which I am failing to understand because of my lack of previous experience! I still pursued it the way I could, meaning, through patient reading, thinking, understanding, re-reading, searching for alternate sources, watching related videos, more thinking and finally some experimenting (using tools like MATLAB) to see if I finally got the hang of it.

Every couple of days, I would unearth some new concept that would strengthen my basics in a way which would make it simpler for me to understand the topic I had learned a few days before. I would then revisit those topics at a glance and try to fit everything had amassed so far into a possibly wholesome mental picture. Bit by bit, it seemed like my actual work would finally start making progress. Whether it will or not is a different question altogether.

I would declare that my attempt as fruitful : a controlled experiment on control engineering.
