[Capgras Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capgras_delusion) or Capgras Delusion is an unusual neurological disorder known in common parlance as the "imposter syndrome". People affected by this condition seem to lose their connection between the vision they see and the corresponding emotional response to that vision. When they see someone who is close to them, like their parents, spouse or children, they recognise their faces but do not experience the flood of "warmth" that usually accompanies the sight of someone they love. Since there's no warmth, they assume the person is an "imposter", someone who is identical to their loved one but not really them.

Surprisingly, this doesn't seem to affect them when they listen to them over the phone, hinting that the auditory pathway is different from the visual pathway. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a cure to the condition. This, like many other neurological disorders, has its root in some reworking of brain circuitry and such conditions help throw more light on the working of the brain.

I learnt about this because I've been resuming my reading of [Phantoms in The Brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantoms_in_the_Brain) by [V. S. Ramachandran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilayanur_S._Ramachandran). It is a very insightful book. I got introduced to Prof. V. S. Ramachandran, the Sherlock Holmes of brain research, and his books by another book lover and brain enthusiast. I didn't waste a single second in purchasing the book when I saw it in the airport bookstore a couple of months back. Â If you're even a tiny bit into learning the workings of the brain, chances are that you already have heard about him but if you haven't, you know now. Prof. V. S. Ramachandran delivered the [BBC Reith Lectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reith_Lectures) in 2003 titled "[The Emerging Mind](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/reith2003/)".
