Am I supposed to write about me or the blog? I'll do both, just in case.


### First up, who am I?


I am a learner, explorer, optimist, thinker, believer, I could add some more words here but I'm not going to because the idea has been conveyed. If you look around in the blog, you'll understand that I take a lot of pride in appreciating everything that's around. In my opinion, everything that one needs to know is out there waiting for them to find out. So one must just start that journey and never stop learning. That's exactly what I want to do, for as long as I am here.


### What's this blog about?


This is going to be the chronicle of my explorations, which could be anything as long as it's sufficiently backed with interesting implications. I'll also try to add links to where I'm learning things from. I am not going to impose a standard format on the posts, instead I'm going let it evolve on its own. This means that not all posts will be consistent, but that's okay because this will teach me to not be a perfectionist.


### So, do stick around and see if you like it here.
